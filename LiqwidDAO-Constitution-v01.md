## Constitution of the LiqwidDAO Community Association
### Originally Adopted 15th August, 2022, Cardano Epoch 357

## Preamble
As Liqwid ecosystem participants and builders on the Cardano blockchain, the members of LiqwidDAO pool resources to create this organization that will be of service to our diverse community. Our founding team members consist of highly driven individuals from all corners of the globe, each bringing their unique identities, worldviews and experiences. We build in unison as a team sharing a collective vision to provide the DAO and DeFi products that will allow us to coordinate and transact in a novel web3 model that prioritizes transparency and fairness above all else.

Our team strives to implement the organization's operational model in accordance with the core fundamentals decentralized blockchain networks represent. Our objectives shall be community shaped, our documentation open source, and our outcomes auditable to all. The LiqwidDAO will leverage Agora on-chain governance modules for proposal submission, voting and other community governance actions. The Liqwid Community Discord server (https://discord.com/invite/vZzGHKGz29) is open to all and includes a #gov-discussion and #temp-check channels used to catalyze discussion on specific governance ideas. The LiqwidDAO Governance Forum (https://gov.liqwid.finance/) allows anyone to submit temperature checks and proposals in a more formal setting meant for long form debates and discussions on specific points. The goal of using off-chain governance channels and forums is to build an inclusive system where all individuals who wish to participate in governance have the opportunity, and Agora on-chain governance smart contracts that guarantees that the decision of the majority shall be executed to move the protocol forward. Anyone may join or leave the DAO freely while we collaborate on the development of open source tools that are used by everyone but owned by no one.

In our natural alignment with the ethos behind Cardano's on-chain governance system Project Catalyst, the goal of our organization shall be the same: Provide a safe and lively environment for you to explore the highest potential of human collaboration.

# Article I - Organization

**Section 1.1 - Status.** LiqwidDAO Community Association (referred to in this agreement as "LiqwidDAO") is an unincorporated nonprofit decentralized autonomous organization operating on the Cardano blockchain.

LiqwidDAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.

**Section 1.2 - Purposes.** LiqwidDAO's core purpose is to build the tools & products that deliver value to both users of the Liqwid protocol and developers building on top of it. Coordinating to innovate on the existing DeFi model and bring more traditional finance and corporate governance products on-chain using Plutus smart contracts as coded agreements accessible by anyone with a Cardano wallet. We feel strongly that decentralized finance primitives represent a level playing field in terms of access to on-chain liquidity and as a result are themselves public goods that must be freely accessible to everyone around the world, always. If traditional financial services were as accessible, transparent, and auditable as on-chain financial services we could all benefit from life in a more equitable world. Consumer and institutional lending and borrowing products could be greatly enhanced by the composability and automation blockchain and smart contract technologies offers.

Our Mission Statement (may be updated via governance): LiqwidDAO is organized as a global cooperative to deploy secure DeFi and governance products and tooling that enforces financial contract parameters and human coordination rules with code as opposed to trust. We seek to introduce novel deterministic tools with open participation and sustainable growth models that don't rely on trusted parties on a cooperative and nonprofit basis.

**Section 1.3 - Not a Financial Services Company.**  LiqwidDAO is not organized to and shall not provide financial services, advice, or investment opportunities. The documentation created by LiqwidDAO members, with the exception of personal identifying data, shall be made available in the public domain or under an open source license depending upon the specific functionality the documentation covers. LiqwidDAO products and tools should not be misconstrued as investment opportunities; no promises are made that they will hold any monetary value or provide any monetary returns.

**Section 1.4 - Cooperative principles.** LiqwidDAO shall be operated in the spirit of cooperative principles framed by the 1995 General Assembly of the International Co-operative Alliance, including:

1. voluntary and open membership;
2. democratic member control through distributed ledger smart contract voting management;
3. member economic participation;
4. autonomy and independence of LiqwidDAO;
5. providing education, training and information;
6. cooperation with other DAO cooperatives; and
7. concern for the community.

**Section 1.5 - Nondiscrimination.** LiqwidDAO shall not arbitrarily discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, or otherwise.

**Section 1.6 - Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).** LiqwidDAO is a DAO, an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons who all agree to join together in a common purpose. For LiqwidDAO that purpose is encapsulated in our Mission Statement.

**Section 1.7 - Term and Continuation of DAO.** LiqwidDAO will continue perpetually so long as Members vote to continue the activities of the organization. Should the members ever deem it necessary to cease operation of the DAO they shall transfer the treasury to community voted trustee(s) who shall distribute the assets to charitable organizations in line with the ethos and Mission Statement of LiqwidDAO.
